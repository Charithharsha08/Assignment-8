        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming
          language that is primarily used for client-side scripting on the web.
          Itâ€™s often abbreviated as JS.
        </p>

        <h3>JS Features</h3>
        Dynamic: JavaScript code can manipulate and change the Document Object
        Model (DOM) of an HTML document, making web pages interactive and
        dynamic.
        <p>
          Interpreted: JavaScript code is executed line-by-line by a JavaScript
          engine, such as V8 (used by Google Chrome) or SpiderMonkey (used by
          Mozilla Firefox), rather than being compiled beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object-oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP)
          concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
          First-class
        </p>
        <p>
          functions: Functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they
          can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from
          functions, and stored in data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common Uses: Client-side scripting: JavaScript is used to add
          interactivity to web pages, such as responding to user input, updating
          content, and animating graphics. Server-side programming: Node.js, a
          JavaScript runtime environment, allows JavaScript to be used for
          server-side programming, enabling the creation of web servers, APIs,
          and microservices. Desktop and mobile applications: JavaScript is used
          in frameworks like Electron and React Native to build desktop and
          mobile applications.
